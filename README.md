To get started you will need to download and install XAMPP. You need to make sure that Apache, MySQL, and PHP are installed, but they should be by default. XAMPP generally installs into the C drive if available. After installation is complete, open the configuration panel and activate Apache and MySQL. You can test everyting is working by opening a Web Browser and going to http://localhost/dashboard/, you should see a welcome to XAMPP screen.
